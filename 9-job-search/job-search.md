### Pro Tip (from johnwark, 12/10)
* When you save your resume pdf, make sure the file name starts with your name, e.g. joe smith resume.pdf or joe smith resume dec 2015.pdf or some such.  File names like resume.pdf are USELESS when they are received by someone getting lots of copies of resumes, e.g. like a hiring manager.
