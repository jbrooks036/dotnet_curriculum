# Object-Relational Mapping

###### Sonda's Notes
* ORM is Object Relational Mapping.
* ORM is the translator mapping between the model and the specific database type so that they are able to talk to each other.
* Object Relational Mapping means that it takes the objects in your code and lines them up with the data you have in your database.
  * A model is simply a class. The attributes you care about are what make the model unique, and you specify these as properties in your class.
* The Entity Framework is a type of ORM and applies the repository pattern to the program.
