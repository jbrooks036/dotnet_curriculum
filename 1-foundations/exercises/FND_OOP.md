# Object-Oriented Programming Exercises

### Eliza's Sharp Shapes
Eliza had a really good OOP exercise "Sharp Shapes" which was (unfortunately) oriented towards and implemented in WPF.  I'm not sure how easy/hard it would be to assign it without also requiring students to take on WPF also.  Perhaps someone (TA) could implement a WPF viewer that the students could just use w/out programming to it.  [Needs further investigation.]

Basics included:
 - shapes w/ 3 or more # sides
 - shapes w/ 4 sides included rectangle, square, rhombus, trapezoid, parallelogram
 - shapes w/ different color fills
 - methods for calculating circumference, area of each shape

Details, including implementation notes from Sonda, are in "Orphaned-for-Now" section, EXERCISES folder.
