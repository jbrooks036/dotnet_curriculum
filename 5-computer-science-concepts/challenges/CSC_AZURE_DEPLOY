# Azure Challenge

#### This is from Sonda's notes

### Azure Deployment

#### TODO PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT
* All your code committed
* Working migrations (be careful just deleting migrations, in fact, don’t do it.  What you need to do is write a new migration that deletes what the migration you want to remove did)
* File/Image Uploads - default thing to do is store it on the machine that’s running (in a pictures folder let’s say).  Can’t do that anymore.  We will go through all these steps when the time comes (Jurnell currently sick).
