# Adding Views to Project
* https://github.com/NashvilleSoftwareSchool/jitter-juniper/commit/7f9e28efd5cd6812b85cc95f5d8bdc15d1ee9ad2

* Move `NavBar` out of shared `_Layout`, and turn it into a partial.
* `Bundles` - provide additional resources to project
* [from Sonda's notes:] You donâ€™t want to put `Using` statements into the views because the views are supposed to be a dumb kind of thing that just shows things, not handles any logic. That being said, the generated code has a Using in the `_LoginPartial` to show your user email when greeting you.


### Helper Methods
* Facilities to help develop views
* ?? What else to say about Helper Methods??
